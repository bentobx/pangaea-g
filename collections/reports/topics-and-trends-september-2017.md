### Canada

#### Health Canada Proposal for Fee Updates

Health Canada has posted its new fee proposal for drugs and medical devices and has invited stakeholders to provide feedback until January 4, 2018. It appears as though there will be substantial increases as the Regulatory agency wants to recover the majority of its costs. What seem to be missing from this update are any actual performance measurement criteria.

#### Federal Cost of a National Pharmacare Program

The Parliamentary Budget Officer (PBO) provides independent analyses to Parliament “to estimate the financial cost of any proposal for matters over which Parliament has jurisdiction”. In 2016, the House of Commons Standing Committee on Health requested the PBO to provide a cost estimate of implementing a national Pharmacare program. The resulting [Federal Cost of a National Pharmacare Program](www.pbo-dpb.gc.ca/web/default/files/Documents/Reports/2017/Pharmacare/Pharmacare_EN.pdf) was published Sept 28, 2017 and provides a five-year projection of federal costs up to 2020-2021.

The framework for this analysis is based on the Quebec formulary, including eligibility requirements, co-payment levels, and eligibility for co-payment exemptions. Of the $28.5 billion in estimated pharmaceutical expenses in 2015-16, $24.6 billion would be eligible for a national Pharmacare program. These are costs currently incurred by governments ($11.9 billion), private insurance plans ($9.0 billion), and patients ($3.6 billion). The findings show a total spend of $20.4 billion if national Pharmacare had been implemented in 2015-16, representing an estimated savings of $4.2 billion. By 2020-21 the net cost of Pharmacare would be estimated at $23.7 billion.

While the analysis does not factor in the savings from a single administrator of drug benefit claims vs the multiple administrators across the county, it does take into account the fact that previously uninsured individuals and those with better public (vs private) coverage will increase utilization. Other assumptions on which these calculations are based include:

-   The lowest price currently obtained by public and private insurance plans in Canada, and and additional 25 per cent universal discount (on top of current PLA’s);
-   Universal generic drug substitution;
-   Public coverage of Quebec formulary drugs only, and not all drugs;
-   Applying a $5 co-payment for each brand name prescription.

*While the chatter of a national Pharmacare program does indeed grow stronger every year with many more voices now adding to the noise, the new Health Minister, Ginette Petitpas Taylor, has not yet provided insight with respect to her views and commitment on this issue. The previous Minister, Jane Philpott had pushed back on this subject citing drug spend a provincial matter.*

#### Patented Medicines Regulations Proposed Amendments Consultations

-   **IMC Voices Concern:**
    In response to the Consultation Document regarding amendments to the Patented Medicines Regulations, Innovative Medicines Canada believes the proposed changes will add “significant complexity to the already complicated and lengthy process”. As well IMC claims the current Regulations, Guidelines, and/or processes have shown the ability to address any excessively priced patented medicine. In response to some of the specific proposals, IMC’s stance is [^1]:
    -   R&D tracking must be updated and transitioned to feds
    -   Canada to benchmark against leading global economies and health systems, not the OECD median
        -   US should remain comparator country
    -   PMPRB not incorporate pharmacoeconomic analysis as factor for price
    -   PMPRB not use market size as factor to assess excessiveness of price
    -   PMPRB not use GDP as factor in price assessment
        -   A complaint-driven process for generic drugs must be extended to other low-risk products (i.e. patented branded medicines without market exclusivity, vaccines, blood products, and products within a competitive class or sharing a similar mechanism of action).
    -   No to mandatory submission of patentee indirect price reduction information
-   **CORD Doesn’t Hold Back:**
    In the words of the Canadian Organization for Rare Disorders’ (CORD), it is “nigh near impossible” to provide a thoughtful response to the proposed amendments of the Patented Medicines Regulations, given the lack of health policy and pharmaceutical policy context to properly understand how the proposed amendments will affect access to and appropriate use of medicines.[^2] The organization continues in its response to ask why the Government has not provided background information, research outcomes and analyses etc. to properly assess the proposed amendments.

    Given that the Government of Canada has not moved forward with the Orphan Drug Regulatory Framework, CORD “feels that this omission along with the special attention to the “price” of orphan drugs will serve to further reduce the incentives for researchers and manufacturers to bring drugs for rare diseases and other small patient populations in a timely fashion.”[^3]

*CORD is very upfront in its response, identifying the lack of suitable data from which to properly access the proposed Regulations as well as posing some very interesting questions back to the Health Canada. Hopefully the government will consider all the feedback carefully before positioning drug cost in place of further innovation.*

#### Alexion SOLIRIS Decision

Back in 2015, the Patented Medicines Price Review Board (PMPRB) Staff filed a Statement of Allegations claiming the price of SOLIRIS was excessive between 2012 and 2014 as per section 83 and 85 of the Patent Act. On September 20, 2017 the PMPRB hearing panel determined the price was indeed excessive and ordered Alexion to reduce the price of SOLIRIS so that it does not exceed the lowest price among the seven comparator countries and pay $5,617,480.42 to offset the cumulative excess revenues the company had received during this period.[^4]

The Canadian Life and Health Insurance Association (CLHIA) had argued that private payers should be compensated for covering the excessive costs of SOLIRIS for plan members. However, the PMPRB panel determined Alexion to pay the federal crown for the excessive revenues and to the CLHIA’s reproach, did not consider any reimbursement to plan sponsors or insurers.[^5]

Alexion will be seeking judicial review of the decision.

*How can the PMPRB create new regulations in the midst of the Alexion case and require the company to lower the list price of SOLIRIS in Canada to no higher than the lowest price in the seven comparator countries set out in the current Patented Medicines Regulations? What happened to the Median International Price Comparison test (MIPC)*? *Is this a preview of what will be finalized for the Patented Medicines Regulations amendments?*

#### CADTH: New Funding and New Strategy

At the recent CADTH webinar October 3, 2017, the health technology agency announced new federal funding of $36 million over 5 years and introduced its Health Technology Management Strategy with respect to building “on the science of HTA with an increased focus on lifecycle management, stakeholder engagement, and implementation support”. Within this strategy were four key areas of focus:

1.  Governance and Priority Setting:

-   CADTH will broaden its scope of evidence reviews to meet needs of groups such as Indigenous peoples, mental health community, and Canadians living in rural, remote and northern areas
-   Scan the environment for emerging technologies
-   Support to CADTH customers - for instance if a national Pharmacare formulary becomes a reality, CADTH will support jurisdictions

2.  Assessment and Evaluation throughout the Technology Lifecycle

-   Alignment of HTA and Regulatory reviews which may require prioritized system versus first in first out
-   Expand/evolve CADTH Scientific Advice program
-   Framework design for Real World Data use in Canada that could lead to drug/ device reassessments 1-2 years post launch

3.  Strengthening the Evidence-to Action Connection

-   Provide enhanced implementation support for jurisdictions and increase resources at the local level
-   Enhance engagement with clinicians

4.  Measuring Impact and Improving Value for Money

-   Internal performance measurements for CADTH itself

*Dr. Brian O’Rourke, President and CEO of CADTH recognized the many projects in which the agency is engaging and developing. While many of these initiatives won’t come to fruition in the very near future, he did emphasize the need for companies to understand the impact of a prioritized system. At this point, however, we have no knowledge on how prioritization would be managed.*

#### Federal Review of pan-Canadian Health Organizations

The new federal Minister of Health, Ginette Petitpas Taylor has announced a review of the eight federally funded pan-Canadian health organizations (PCHOs) that focus on specific aspects of the health care system:

-   *Canadian Centre on Substance Use* and Addiction (CCSA)
-   *Canadian Agency for Drugs and Technologies in Health* (CADTH)
-   *Canadian Institute for Health Information* (CIHI)
-   *Canadian Foundation for Healthcare Improvement* (CFHI)
-   *Canada Health Infoway*
-   *Canadian Patient Safety Institute* (CPSI)
-   *Canadian Partnership Against Cancer* (CPAC)
-   *Mental Health Commission of Canada* (MHCC)

This review will be carried out by two health policy experts, Dr. Pierre-Gerlier Forest and Dr. Danielle Martin who have actually been asked to “explore the future role of these organizations in light of a number of critical challenges and priorities facing the health system”.

Input will also be sought from stakeholders who have experience working with these PCHOs through a pre-set list of questions that address the strengths, successes, weaknesses of the PCHO regarding the advancement of federal and pan-Canadian health system priorities. The questions also ask how the organizations can work more efficiently with governments, researchers, patients, and the private sector to improve their impact on health care and even how well the PCHOs function as a group to advance our health care system including synergies and gaps.

See [External Review of Pan-Canadian Health Organizations: Guidelines and Questions for Stakeholders](https://www.canada.ca/en/health-canada/programs/external-advisory-body-pan-canadian-health-organizations/external-review-stakeholder-guidelines-questions.html) for more information on timelines and limitations to responses.

#### Are User Fees the Way Forward?

It’s time to implement user fees or our health care system will not be sustainable, is the message from Brett Skinner, CEO of the Canadian Health Policy Institute (CHPI).[^6] In 2015, provincial health care spend was on average 43% of total available revenue, including federal health transfers. CHPI stresses that without these federal transfers of money, provinces would not be able to sustain health care and it has only been due to increased taxes and restricting spend that has allowed the system to maintain its current policies as per the Canada Health Act. However, according to Skinner, it is time to at least pilot the feasibility of removing the prohibited concepts of extra-billing, co-payments and user fees and explore some of these cost-sharing systems used in many other countries. As a pilot project, the impact of these fees on healthcare utilization could be analyzed and better understood as a means to move forward with healthcare and find solutions to the overwhelming burden on provincial budgets.

This issue of a sustainable health care system was also brought forward recently by the Quebec Minister of Health. Federal funding does not match the increasing health care expenditure experienced by all provinces year after year and Dr. Barrette questions whether the Canada Health Act needs to transform “to meet patient needs during a critical period of the aging of Canada’s population, from 2031 to 2051”.[^15]

*Chances are governments will lean towards more socialized policies like advocating for Pharmacare that make them look good rather than move away from the current Canada Health Act. While drugs are only a small portion of health care spend, they get all the attention and can serve politicians well to jump on this band wagon.*

#### Trying to Slow the Use of Codeine and Indirectly the Opioid Epidemic

600 million low-dose codeine tablets were sold in Canada (2015 data) and now Health Canada, in an attempt to help curb the codeine epidemic, is proposing to prohibit non-prescription (behind the counter) sales of any codeine product. As such, pain medications, cough syrups and other medicines will require a prescription if they contain any element of codeine.

### US/ EUROPE

#### The Global Generic Movement

The International Pharmaceutical Federation (FIP), with membership of 4 million pharmacists from 130 countries, is trying to cultivate the use of generic substitution, throughout the world and at a recent meeting was focusing its efforts on advancing the use of generic medicines in Korea where generic substitution is at only 1%.

The Federation that works in conjunction with the World Health Organization (WHO) on Good Pharmacy Practice, advocates for global use of International Non-proprietary Names (INN) prescription. “The share of global generic use increased from 32.5% in 2005 to 56.2% in 2015”. The share of generic medicines in the US is close to 85% of scripts, Japan’s use of generics has grown substantially from 7% in 2004 to 60% in 2015 and the country wants to continue this upward trajectory to 80% by 2018-2020 and in Canada, just over 70% of scripts are filled by generics.[^7]

#### Initiatives of the FDA

The new FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb wants to build more efficient R&D models in order to cut down on the costs of drug development and in turn reduce the price of drugs for patients. He identified some methods such as the use of “combined-phase” studies whereby a continuous trial design includes various phases that are separated by interim looks. Instead of several phase 2 studies and a large phase 3 study, this one “seamless trial” is believed to save time and money and doesn’t require as many patients overall for enrollment. Gottlieb is also a proponent of real world evidence and advocates for the use of evidence from real world settings to better identify the true value of a drug for patients.

Exactly how much it does cost to bring a drug through development to market is a controversial question. Studies have revealed costs anywhere from a mere $650 million to $2.87 billion and when factoring in all the failures along the way, as Forbes magazine did, shows costs closer to the $5 billion mark.[^8]

#### California Passes Bills re: Disclosure of Price Increase and Co-pay Limits

Bill SB 17 was passed in the California State Assembly and signed by the Governor to mandate greater transparency in drug prices relating to both public and private health plans. This legislation will require pharmaceutical companies to notify private health insurers and the public, government run plans, 60 days in advance of any prescription drug price increase that is greater than 16% (over a two-year period) and to explain the rationale for this increase. The Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America (PhRMA) and BIO are vehemently opposed to this bill stating that it will only provide transparency on list prices but does not take into account any rebates or discounts. As well the pharmaceutical and biotech associations are concerned that transparency regarding insurers’ charges are not incorporated into this bill (though private insurers will have to file annual reports to show how healthcare premiums are affected by drug prices). Could this be the first major step towards price controls and could it become a prototype towards national price regulations?

A separate bill also signed by the governor of California will limit the use of co-pay coupons for branded prescription drugs when a generic is available. Once again the PhRMA is opposed to the bill and at the very least would like to ensure there are some exceptions e.g. for patients who receive prior approval, or if the brand is deemed medically necessary by the prescriber etc.

#### 100% Guarantee

Outcomes based pricing is growing in popularity among US insurers whereby the cost of the drug to the insurer is based on performance using pre-determined targets. If a patient doesn’t respond to the drug, the manufacturer will rebate the insurer 100% of the cost. As identified in the Wall Street Journal, Novartis recently signed an agreement with U.S. Centres for Medicare and Medicaid Services whereby the pharma manufacturer will only be paid if patients respond to KYMRIAH (for leukemia) within one month. As prescription drug spend in the U.S. has reached over $350 billion, the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America feel these deals are a reasonable measure to implement giving Insurers willingness to list these brands as preferred drugs in their formularies.

However, critics believe that most of these outcomes based deals don’t really save anyone any money as the drugs in many of these negotiations have met their targets. As well it takes time and effort to track patient compliance and outcomes. Some insurers are seeking new models to assess performance and to do away with confidentiality clauses, ensuring deals are fully transparent by publishing results of the outcomes.^8

## Provinces

### Ontario

#### When a Biosimilar is Not the Same

While many provincial governments are adopting a biosimilar only reimbursement design for drug naïve patients, the one-size-fits-all process for these drugs may be pulled into question. For one, the ODB recently approved the use of the original biologic NEUPOGEN (see Summary of Changes August 2017, Code 501), for patients unable to use the biosimilar, GRASTOFIL due to documented latex allergy. (NEUPOGEN is reimbursed only in Limited Use situations, whereby the biosimilar GRASTOFIL does not have LU requirements).

*We don’t know how many people this affects but very interesting that this difference between original biologic and its biosimilar was enough allow continued reimbursement of NEUPOGEN. Will we see drug plans returning to the original biologic in other therapeutic areas too?*

#### Ban on e-vouchers

The Ontario Minister of Health, Eric Hoskins, has swept in quickly to prohibit the use of electronic brand vouchers following a Toronto Star report on their use.[^9] As identified in Topic and Trends IV, Telus Health had defended its software program that digitally inserts brand name vouchers (paid for by pharma) on the patient’s prescription.

The Health Minister believes that prescribing decisions are being influenced by the use of these electronic vouchers and as such is mandating the disablement of this feature. Telus maintains that the vouchers were not influencing use of specific drugs as these coupons were only offered AFTER the physician had made his/her treatment decision and was being offered to offset the cost for the brand if the patient’s plan only covered the generic.

#### Ontario Brings Some Home Care Relief

Ontario will be adding 2.6 million hours of home and community care that includes:

-   1.5 million additional hours of personal support services, which includes help with bathing, dressing and exercising
-   390,000 additional hours of nursing care, which includes one-on-one care from a nurse for services such as palliative care, wound care and dressing changes

Ontario is also investing an additional $100 million in 2017-18 in home care supports and services and for community supports, such as meals on wheels, day programs, caregiver supports and assisted living services by $18 million in 2017-18.

*Are these programs the result of the “strings attached” approach to the federal transfer payments (re: home care and mental health) or just the Liberals planning for next year’s election? Whichever they may be the result of, this new funding will no doubt be well received.*

### Quebec

#### A Closer Look at Your Pharmacy Receipt

It has started…as of Sept 15, Quebec pharmacies must implement greater transparency in their billing practices. As per Bill 92, the Act to extend the powers of the Régie de l'assurance maladie du Québec, a detailed description of all the charges must now be identified separately on all receipts for prescription medicines. The Canadian Life and Health Insurance Association (CLHIA) want to educate Quebecers in the hopes that this new transparency will make an impact on the one variable cost, the Pharmacist's fee. The invoice for a prescription drug will now itemize the cost of the drug, the distributor’s margin and the pharmacist’s fee. While the pharmacist’s fee is determined for publicly funded medications, there is no price regulation when the drug is covered by private insurance. Through the campaign that just kicked off titled [My Pharmacy Invoice](http://mypharmacyinvoice.ca/) the CLHIA is hoping to sway private plan members to visit pharmacies with lower fees. Some facts posted by the CLHIA show that:

-   On average, there is a 17% gap between the fees pharmacists charged to Quebecers covered under private group plans and those covered by the public plan.
-   Quebec's employees and employers that have group insurance plans pay close to half a billion dollars more each year than if they had been covered under the public plan as a result of higher pharmacists' fees.

*Will the education campaign prompt Quebecers to shop around for the best pharmacist fee? Even if their private plans are covering the cost?*

#### PA’s and Acquisition of Generics

As previously announced through Pangaea Express, the Bill 128 flip flop that sets professional allocations (PA’s) to pharmacists back to 15%, will become effective on October 19, 2017. This was published in the Official Gazette October 4, 2017.

Until this date, PA's were still uncapped, which means that pharmacists may have carried out some pantry-filling shopping of generics until the implementation of the regulation on October 19.

In addition, the new Bill 148, that stipulates how pharmacies can acquire their generic drugs, was recently introduced by the Quebec Health Minister, Gaetan Barrette, at the National Assembly. Bill 148 is essentially around three amendments;

1.  Pharmacies must not purchase more than 50% of their generic drugs from one manufacturer
2.  Pharmacies will have to report yearly purchases made for generic products
3.  Penalty will be charged to pharmacies who do not comply to the 50% quota.

Bill 148 will be subject to the normal review process at the National Assembly. It is difficult at this time to estimate the timeframe for which this legislation will sanctioned and implemented.

### Manitoba

#### Health Transfer….Check ✓

Manitoba, the last hold-out in a health-funding agreement with the feds, has finally signed on the dotted line. Dr. Philpott, the former Health Minister, could leave her post with a key task crossed off her list. As with the other provinces, Manitoba will receive additional funds specifically allocated to home care and mental health as per the federal mandate. Manitoba will also receive a one-time $5 million payment to fight kidney disease and address the opioid issue

#### Nurses to Prescribe

Manitoba will be creating a new category of registered nurses called Registered Nurse Authorized Prescriber which as the name suggests, will allow these nurses to write prescriptions related to travel health, reproductive health, sexually transmitted infections, blood-borne pathogens and diabetes.

*Expanded scope measures continue across the country and we can expect more to come…*

### Payers

#### A No to Generic Substitution

Union employees of a plant in Timmins Ontario will have the ability to choose either brand or generic following an arbitration decision that ruled against mandatory generic substitution. Even though the company argued that they were satisfying its obligation to provide a drug insurance plan, the collective agreement had not specifically negotiated for mandatory generic substitution and as such the company could not impose such a requirement.[^10]

#### More Union Battles with Drugs

As identified in an investigation by CBC[^11], some employee unions are fighting the mandatory use of mail order pharmacies for drug prescriptions. While employers have implemented the use of this delivery method to curtail money on their escalating drug budgets, there are enough employees who have complained about missing their medication deliveries given out-of-town job requirements. The same holds true for some Preferred Provider Networks, whereby employees oppose the constraint to visit specific pharmacies for their medication.

*These two cases represent the discontent employees feel about being told what medications they are or are not allowed to use and how they can access their meds. While the choice of medication should be between the patient and his/ her health care provider, the outcome of the first case will likely just result in one more issue to grapple over when negotiating collective agreements.*

*In the case regarding mandated route of drug delivery, though outlawed in Quebec, it is not likely mail order pharmacies and PPNs are going away any time soon in the rest of the country given the savings incurred with such arrangements.*

### Channels

#### Technology Creates a Win-Win for Pharmacy and Patient

Question Pour un Pharmacien (Ask Your Pharmacist) is a website founded by Alexandre Chagnon whereby patients can pose a question to a network of pharmacists throughout the country. Questions are sent to the 3 closest community-based pharmacists who can respond accordingly. The patient receives an e-mail notification showing who responded. As well, every Q&A is stored in an accessible database for anyone to peruse using a search bar so that others may benefit from previous questions asked. As pharmacytimes.com illustrates in an example, the response to the question, “Do I have to take a new dose if I threw up 45 minutes after taking my azithromycin?” has been seen by 1,000 patients since March 2015, providing the pharmacist who responded with ample viewership and saving on many face to face consultations that require time and money. The service is free for patients and Chagnon hopes in the future, to receive a fee-for-consultation payment from the government based on performance.[^12]

#### Tapping Into the Baby Boomer Market

Shoppers Drug Mart is diving deeper to align its products with the needs of baby boomers. It has opened its first WELLWISE retail store in Toronto devoting shelf space for active living products for seniors from walking aids for hiking to home comfort devices and other mobility gadgets. These products will also be available on-line for purchase.

#### Grocery and Pharmacy Chains Come Together Again

Two well-known Quebec establishments are looking to align as the grocery chain, Metro, has announced its plans to acquire the provinces largest pharmacy chain and family owned business, Jean Coutu for $4.5 billion. Metro has stores only in Quebec and Ontario while Jean Coutu operates in New Brunswick and Ontario but 90% of its stores are in Quebec.

*Given the approval from the Competition Bureau for the Loblaw acquisition of Shoppers Drug Mart, it is likely this deal will sanctioned as well.*

### Industry

#### Transferring a Patent 2017 Style

“How to Protect a Drug Patent? Sell it to a Native American Tribe”, reads the headline in a New York Times article[^13] and is exactly what Allergan has done. The company has transferred its patents for RESTATSIS to the Saint Regis Mohawk Tribe in upstate New York, who can claim “sovereign immunity” in order to dismiss a patent challenge. The tribe will lease the patents back to Allergan and receive financial payment for this transaction.

In the US, Patents can be challenged by both the Patent Trial and Appeal Board (part of the United States Patent and Trademark Office) and also by the federal courts. By transferring patent rights, Allergan is trying to dismiss an ongoing patent challenge through this Trademark office. In transferring the drug patent, Brent Saunders, Chief Executive of Allergan, is making a statement of protest regarding the need for manufactures to defend their patents in two very different forums.

### Tidbits and Technology

#### Canada brought into 21st Century

Canada Health Infoway already has agreements with six provinces: Alberta, Ontario, Manitoba, Nova Scotia, New Brunswick and Newfoundland and Labrador regarding the electronic transmission of prescriptions. “PrescribeIT™ integrates with doctors’ electronic medical records and enables them to send prescriptions electronically as data to the pharmacy’s system for fulfillment.” Patients can still select the pharmacy of their choice. Canada Health Infoway is also working with community pharmacy companies and has already secured more than 2,600 stores in these six provinces. Ontario has already launched PrescribeIT™ where it is being rolled out in Huntsville and will be following by implementation in Alberta in the fall.

*It would not be surprising if the uptake of PrescribeIT was a fairly quick – considering many other countries have already antiquated the use of paper scripts. Will pre-authorization forms required by private insurers or provincial authorization forms for the various special authority programs be accessed at the time of sending the eprescription?*

#### Uptake of Electronic Medical Records Continues

The new Canada Health Infoway, [Use of EMR among Canadian Physicians 2017 Update](https://www.infoway-inforoute.ca/en/component/edocman/resources/reports/benefits-evaluation/3362-2017-cma-workforce-survey-digital-health-results?Itemid=101) shows that the use of EMRs among physicians is continually growing. Since the last survey, conducted in 2014, EMR adoption by general practitioners has grown to 84%, up from 77%. Physicians in Alberta have the greatest rate of use at 91% EMR adoption rate. Specialist use of EMRs is growing with 79% adoption vs 73% back in 2014.

*While only 10% of patients can eView their records or eBook appointments, this figure will likely grow over the next few years especially in light of advancements made in other technology related health programs such as virtual physician visits, and the launch of the eprescription software, PrescribeIT™.*

#### IBM Watson Underwhelms

STAT, the on line publication, carried out an investigation regarding IBM’s “Watson for Oncology” and found its adoption within hospitals is minimal and is the computer not currently living up to expectations. While IBM continues to pour millions towards its Watson health division, with 7,000 employees, the company reports that Watson for Oncology is improving and can already provide treatment guidance for 12 most prevalent cancers. Critics question whether Watson for Oncology is truly providing artificial intelligence as the treatment recommendations are based on information entered into the computer by humans and their own decisions regarding treatment. As well, hospitals outside of the US have complained that Watson is biased towards American patients and the protocols for oncology care in the US. The STAT examination also revealed that IBM has not published scientific papers.[^14]
