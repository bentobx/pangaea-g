            <h4 id="health-canada-proposal-for-fee-updates">Health Canada Proposal for Fee Updates</h4>
            <p>Health Canada has posted its new fee proposal for drugs and medical devices and has invited stakeholders to provide feedback until January 4, 2018. It appears as though there will be substantial increases as the Regulatory agency wants to
              recover the majority of its costs. What seem to be missing from this update are any actual performance measurement criteria.</p>
            <h4 id="federal-cost-of-a-national-pharmacare-program">Federal Cost of a National Pharmacare Program</h4>
            <p>The Parliamentary Budget Officer (PBO) provides independent analyses to Parliament “to estimate the financial cost of any proposal for matters over which Parliament has jurisdiction”. In 2016, the House of Commons Standing Committee on Health
              requested the PBO to provide a cost estimate of implementing a national Pharmacare program. The resulting <a href="www.pbo-dpb.gc.ca/web/default/files/Documents/Reports/2017/Pharmacare/Pharmacare_EN.pdf">Federal Cost of a National Pharmacare Program</a>              was published Sept 28, 2017 and provides a five-year projection of federal costs up to 2020-2021.</p>
            <p>The framework for this analysis is based on the Quebec formulary, including eligibility requirements, co-payment levels, and eligibility for co-payment exemptions. Of the $28.5 billion in estimated pharmaceutical expenses in 2015-16, $24.6
              billion would be eligible for a national Pharmacare program. These are costs currently incurred by governments ($11.9 billion), private insurance plans ($9.0 billion), and patients ($3.6 billion). The findings show a total spend of $20.4
              billion if national Pharmacare had been implemented in 2015-16, representing an estimated savings of $4.2 billion. By 2020-21 the net cost of Pharmacare would be estimated at $23.7 billion.</p>
            <p>While the analysis does not factor in the savings from a single administrator of drug benefit claims vs the multiple administrators across the county, it does take into account the fact that previously uninsured individuals and those with
              better public (vs private) coverage will increase utilization. Other assumptions on which these calculations are based include:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>The lowest price currently obtained by public and private insurance plans in Canada, and and additional 25 per cent universal discount (on top of current PLA’s);</li>
              <li>Universal generic drug substitution;</li>
              <li>Public coverage of Quebec formulary drugs only, and not all drugs;</li>
              <li>Applying a $5 co-payment for each brand name prescription.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><em>While the chatter of a national Pharmacare program does indeed grow stronger every year with many more voices now adding to the noise, the new Health Minister, Ginette Petitpas Taylor, has not yet provided insight with respect to her views and commitment on this issue. The previous Minister, Jane Philpott had pushed back on this subject citing drug spend a provincial matter.</em></p>

            <ul>
              <li><strong>IMC Voices Concern:</strong><br /> In response to the Consultation Document regarding amendments to the Patented Medicines Regulations, Innovative Medicines Canada believes the proposed changes will add “significant complexity to
                the already complicated and lengthy process”. As well IMC claims the current Regulations, Guidelines, and/or processes have shown the ability to address any excessively priced patented medicine. In response to some of the specific proposals,
                IMC’s stance is <a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a>:
                <ul>

              <li style="margin-top: .8rem;">
                <p><strong>CORD Doesn’t Hold Back:</strong><br /> In the words of the Canadian Organization for Rare Disorders’ (CORD), it is “nigh near impossible” to provide a thoughtful response to the proposed amendments of the Patented Medicines Regulations,
                  given the lack of health policy and pharmaceutical policy context to properly understand how the proposed amendments will affect access to and appropriate use of medicines.<a href="#fn2" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a>                  The organization continues in its response to ask why the Government has not provided background information, research outcomes and analyses etc. to properly assess the proposed amendments.</p>
                <p>Given that the Government of Canada has not moved forward with the Orphan Drug Regulatory Framework, CORD “feels that this omission along with the special attention to the “price” of orphan drugs will serve to further reduce the incentives
                  for researchers and manufacturers to bring drugs for rare diseases and other small patient populations in a timely fashion.”<a href="#fn3" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p><em>CORD is very upfront in its response, identifying the lack of suitable data from which to properly access the proposed Regulations as well as posing some very interesting questions back to the Health Canada. Hopefully the government will consider all the feedback carefully before positioning drug cost in place of further innovation.</em></p>
            <h4 id="alexion-soliris-decision">Alexion SOLIRIS Decision</h4>
            <p>Back in 2015, the Patented Medicines Price Review Board (PMPRB) Staff filed a Statement of Allegations claiming the price of SOLIRIS was excessive between 2012 and 2014 as per section 83 and 85 of the Patent Act. On September 20, 2017 the
              PMPRB hearing panel determined the price was indeed excessive and ordered Alexion to reduce the price of SOLIRIS so that it does not exceed the lowest price among the seven comparator countries and pay $5,617,480.42 to offset the cumulative
              excess revenues the company had received during this period.<a href="#fn4" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
            <p>The Canadian Life and Health Insurance Association (CLHIA) had argued that private payers should be compensated for covering the excessive costs of SOLIRIS for plan members. However, the PMPRB panel determined Alexion to pay the federal crown
              for the excessive revenues and to the CLHIA’s reproach, did not consider any reimbursement to plan sponsors or insurers.<a href="#fn5" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a></p>
            <p>Alexion will be seeking judicial review of the decision.</p>
            <p><em>How can the PMPRB create new regulations in the midst of the Alexion case and require the company to lower the list price of SOLIRIS in Canada to no higher than the lowest price in the seven comparator countries set out in the current Patented Medicines Regulations? What happened to the Median International Price Comparison test (MIPC)</em>?
              <em>Is this a preview of what will be finalized for the Patented Medicines Regulations amendments?</em></p>

            <p>At the recent CADTH webinar October 3, 2017, the health technology agency announced new federal funding of $36 million over 5 years and introduced its Health Technology Management Strategy with respect to building “on the science of HTA with
              an increased focus on lifecycle management, stakeholder engagement, and implementation support”. Within this strategy were four key areas of focus:</p>
            <ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
              <li>Governance and Priority Setting:</li>
            </ol>

              <li>CADTH will broaden its scope of evidence reviews to meet needs of groups such as Indigenous peoples, mental health community, and Canadians living in rural, remote and northern areas</li>
              <li>Scan the environment for emerging technologies</li>
              <li>Support to CADTH customers - for instance if a national Pharmacare formulary becomes a reality, CADTH will support jurisdictions</li>

            <p><em>Dr. Brian O’Rourke, President and CEO of CADTH recognized the many projects in which the agency is engaging and developing. While many of these initiatives won’t come to fruition in the very near future, he did emphasize the need for companies to understand the impact of a prioritized system. At this point, however, we have no knowledge on how prioritization would be managed.</em></p>
            <h4 id="federal-review-of-pan-canadian-health-organizations">Federal Review of pan-Canadian Health Organizations</h4>
            <p>The new federal Minister of Health, Ginette Petitpas Taylor has announced a review of the eight federally funded pan-Canadian health organizations (PCHOs) that focus on specific aspects of the health care system:</p>
            <ul>
              <li><em>Canadian Centre on Substance Use</em> and Addiction (CCSA)</li>
              <li><em>Canadian Agency for Drugs and Technologies in Health</em> (CADTH) </li>
              <li><em>Canadian Institute for Health Information</em> (CIHI) </li>
              <li><em>Canadian Foundation for Healthcare Improvement</em> (CFHI) </li>
              <li><em>Canada Health Infoway</em> </li>
              <li><em>Canadian Patient Safety Institute</em> (CPSI) </li>
              <li><em>Canadian Partnership Against Cancer</em> (CPAC) </li>
              <li><em>Mental Health Commission of Canada</em> (MHCC) </li>
            </ul>
            <p>This review will be carried out by two health policy experts, Dr. Pierre-Gerlier Forest and Dr. Danielle Martin who have actually been asked to “explore the future role of these organizations in light of a number of critical challenges and
              priorities facing the health system”.</p>
            <p>Input will also be sought from stakeholders who have experience working with these PCHOs through a pre-set list of questions that address the strengths, successes, weaknesses of the PCHO regarding the advancement of federal and pan-Canadian
              health system priorities. The questions also ask how the organizations can work more efficiently with governments, researchers, patients, and the private sector to improve their impact on health care and even how well the PCHOs function
              as a group to advance our health care system including synergies and gaps.</p>

            <h4 id="are-user-fees-the-way-forward">Are User Fees the Way Forward?</h4>
            <p>It’s time to implement user fees or our health care system will not be sustainable, is the message from Brett Skinner, CEO of the Canadian Health Policy Institute (CHPI).<a href="#fn6" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> In 2015,
              provincial health care spend was on average 43% of total available revenue, including federal health transfers. CHPI stresses that without these federal transfers of money, provinces would not be able to sustain health care and it has only
              been due to increased taxes and restricting spend that has allowed the system to maintain its current policies as per the Canada Health Act. However, according to Skinner, it is time to at least pilot the feasibility of removing the prohibited
              concepts of extra-billing, co-payments and user fees and explore some of these cost-sharing systems used in many other countries. As a pilot project, the impact of these fees on healthcare utilization could be analyzed and better understood
              as a means to move forward with healthcare and find solutions to the overwhelming burden on provincial budgets.</p>
            <p>This issue of a sustainable health care system was also brought forward recently by the Quebec Minister of Health. Federal funding does not match the increasing health care expenditure experienced by all provinces year after year and Dr. Barrette

              advancing the use of generic medicines in Korea where generic substitution is at only 1%.</p>
            <p>The Federation that works in conjunction with the World Health Organization (WHO) on Good Pharmacy Practice, advocates for global use of International Non-proprietary Names (INN) prescription. “The share of global generic use increased from
              32.5% in 2005 to 56.2% in 2015”. The share of generic medicines in the US is close to 85% of scripts, Japan’s use of generics has grown substantially from 7% in 2004 to 60% in 2015 and the country wants to continue this upward trajectory
              to 80% by 2018-2020 and in Canada, just over 70% of scripts are filled by generics.<a href="#fn7" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a></p>

            <p>The new FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb wants to build more efficient R&amp;D models in order to cut down on the costs of drug development and in turn reduce the price of drugs for patients. He identified some methods such as the use of “combined-phase”
              studies whereby a continuous trial design includes various phases that are separated by interim looks. Instead of several phase 2 studies and a large phase 3 study, this one “seamless trial” is believed to save time and money and doesn’t require
              as many patients overall for enrollment. Gottlieb is also a proponent of real world evidence and advocates for the use of evidence from real world settings to better identify the true value of a drug for patients.</p>
            <p>Exactly how much it does cost to bring a drug through development to market is a controversial question. Studies have revealed costs anywhere from a mere $650 million to $2.87 billion and when factoring in all the failures along the way, as
              Forbes magazine did, shows costs closer to the $5 billion mark.<a href="#fn8" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a></p>
            <h4 id="california-passes-bills-re-disclosure-of-price-increase-and-co-pay-limits">California Passes Bills re: Disclosure of Price Increase and Co-pay Limits</h4>
            <p>Bill SB 17 was passed in the California State Assembly and signed by the Governor to mandate greater transparency in drug prices relating to both public and private health plans. This legislation will require pharmaceutical companies to notify
              private health insurers and the public, government run plans, 60 days in advance of any prescription drug price increase that is greater than 16% (over a two-year period) and to explain the rationale for this increase. The Pharmaceutical
              Research and Manufacturers of America (PhRMA) and BIO are vehemently opposed to this bill stating that it will only provide transparency on list prices but does not take into account any rebates or discounts. As well the pharmaceutical and
              biotech associations are concerned that transparency regarding insurers’ charges are not incorporated into this bill (though private insurers will have to file annual reports to show how healthcare premiums are affected by drug prices).
              Could this be the first major step towards price controls and could it become a prototype towards national price regulations?</p>
            <p>A separate bill also signed by the governor of California will limit the use of co-pay coupons for branded prescription drugs when a generic is available. Once again the PhRMA is opposed to the bill and at the very least would like to ensure
              there are some exceptions e.g. for patients who receive prior approval, or if the brand is deemed medically necessary by the prescriber etc.</p>
            <h4 id="guarantee">100% Guarantee</h4>
            <p>Outcomes based pricing is growing in popularity among US insurers whereby the cost of the drug to the insurer is based on performance using pre-determined targets. If a patient doesn’t respond to the drug, the manufacturer will rebate the insurer
              100% of the cost. As identified in the Wall Street Journal, Novartis recently signed an agreement with U.S. Centres for Medicare and Medicaid Services whereby the pharma manufacturer will only be paid if patients respond to KYMRIAH (for
              leukemia) within one month. As prescription drug spend in the U.S. has reached over $350 billion, the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America feel these deals are a reasonable measure to implement giving Insurers willingness
              to list these brands as preferred drugs in their formularies.</p>
            <p>However, critics believe that most of these outcomes based deals don’t really save anyone any money as the drugs in many of these negotiations have met their targets. As well it takes time and effort to track patient compliance and outcomes.
              Some insurers are seeking new models to assess performance and to do away with confidentiality clauses, ensuring deals are fully transparent by publishing results of the outcomes.<sup>8</sup></p>

            <p>While many provincial governments are adopting a biosimilar only reimbursement design for drug naïve patients, the one-size-fits-all process for these drugs may be pulled into question. For one, the ODB recently approved the use of the original
              biologic NEUPOGEN (see Summary of Changes August 2017, Code 501), for patients unable to use the biosimilar, GRASTOFIL due to documented latex allergy. (NEUPOGEN is reimbursed only in Limited Use situations, whereby the biosimilar GRASTOFIL
              does not have LU requirements).</p>
            <p><em>We don’t know how many people this affects but very interesting that this difference between original biologic and its biosimilar was enough allow continued reimbursement of NEUPOGEN.

            <p>It has started…as of Sept 15, Quebec pharmacies must implement greater transparency in their billing practices. As per Bill 92, the Act to extend the powers of the Régie de l'assurance maladie du Québec, a detailed description of all the charges must now be identified separately on all receipts for prescription medicines. The Canadian Life and Health Insurance Association (CLHIA) want to educate Quebecers in the hopes that this new transparency will make an impact on the one variable cost, the Pharmacist's fee. The invoice for a prescription drug will now itemize the cost of the drug, the distributor’s margin and the pharmacist’s fee. While the pharmacist’s fee is determined for publicly funded medications, there is no price regulation when the drug is covered by private insurance. Through the campaign that just kicked off titled <a href="http://mypharmacyinvoice.ca/">My Pharmacy Invoice</a> the CLHIA is hoping to sway private plan members to visit pharmacies with lower fees. Some facts posted by the CLHIA show that:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>On average, there is a 17% gap between the fees pharmacists charged to Quebecers covered under private group plans and those covered by the public plan.</li>
              <li>Quebec's employees and employers that have group insurance plans pay close to half a billion dollars more each year than if they had been covered under the public plan as a result of higher pharmacists' fees.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><em>Will the education campaign prompt Quebecers to shop around for the best pharmacist fee? Even if their private plans are covering the cost?</em></p>
            <h4 id="pas-and-acquisition-of-generics">PA’s and Acquisition of Generics</h4>
            <p>As previously announced through Pangaea Express, the Bill 128 flip flop that sets professional allocations (PA’s) to pharmacists back to 15%, will become effective on October 19, 2017. This was published in the Official Gazette October 4,
              2017.
            </p>
            <p>Until this date, PA's were still uncapped, which means that pharmacists may have carried out some pantry-filling shopping of generics until the implementation of the regulation on October 19.</p>
            <p>In addition, the new Bill 148, that stipulates how pharmacies can acquire their generic drugs, was recently introduced by the Quebec Health Minister, Gaetan Barrette, at the National Assembly. Bill 148 is essentially around three amendments;</p>
            <ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
              <li>Pharmacies must not purchase more than 50% of their generic drugs from one manufacturer</li>
              <li>Pharmacies will have to report yearly purchases made for generic products</li>
              <li>Penalty will be charged to pharmacies who do not comply to the 50% quota.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>Bill 148 will be subject to the normal review process at the National Assembly. It is difficult at this time to estimate the timeframe for which this legislation will sanctioned and implemented.</p>

            <p>As identified in an investigation by CBC<a href="#fn11" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a>, some employee unions are fighting the mandatory use of mail order pharmacies for drug prescriptions. While employers have implemented
              the use of this delivery method to curtail money on their escalating drug budgets, there are enough employees who have complained about missing their medication deliveries given out-of-town job requirements. The same holds true for some
              Preferred Provider Networks, whereby employees oppose the constraint to visit specific pharmacies for their medication.</p>
            <p><em>These two cases represent the discontent employees feel about being told what medications they are or are not allowed to use and how they can access their meds. While the choice of medication should be between the patient and his/ her health care provider, the outcome of the first case will likely just result in one more issue to grapple over when negotiating collective agreements.</em></p>
            <p><em>In the case regarding mandated route of drug delivery, though outlawed in Quebec, it is not likely mail order pharmacies and PPNs are going away any time soon in the rest of the country given the savings incurred with such arrangements.</em></p>
