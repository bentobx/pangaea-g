  used by, contained within or accessed in connection with the Services. You may
  not use content from our Services other than as set out in these Terms unless
  you obtain permission from its owner or are otherwise permitted by law. These
  Terms do not grant you the right to use any Pangaea trademarks. Users may not
  remove, obscure, or alter any legal notices displayed in or along with our
  Services.


  Our Website and Services may display content that is not owned by or provided
  by Pangaea. This content is the sole responsibility of the entity that makes
  it available, and your use of this content may be governed by separate terms
  dictated by the content provider. We may review content to ensure it is
  compliant with our policies, and we may remove or refuse to display content
  that we reasonably believe violates our policies or the law; however, not all
  content is reviewed, and Pangaea assumes no responsibility for this third

  ## User Accounts


  You may be required to create a Pangaea account to access certain Services.
  Sometimes, with your permission, we may retrieve credentials from your
  existing account with another entity in order to make account creation easier.
  In order to do this, Pangaea will also have prior permission from the entity
  that manages your existing third party user account. It is your responsibility
  to keep your password confidential. You are responsible for all activity that
  takes place by any user logged in to your Pangaea account. Pangaea advises
  that you choose a unique password for your Pangaea user account, and that you
  do not use the same password to log in to other accounts you may have with
  third party service providers.
